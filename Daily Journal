Day 1: On day 1 I began by creating a replit to create and test the methods. I started by learning about math.PI and E and how long they go for (about 50 digits). I learned to use math.PI and math.E
Used recursion to solve fibinacci sequence where it returns the digit that you type in. The code works with return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2); and if n<=1 returns the digit that one is.
I also used https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html to relearn scanner to help with the find cost of floor method.

Day 2: I finished the changeNeeded and created a vsCode file to use, but I found my code didn't run so I didn't change it. Through the changeNeeded had a forever whiile loop
that I dont understand what the issue is. I was able to fix the while loop and the code works perfectly now. I also began to work on the calculator and used this website
https://www.javatpoint.com/java-math to find the methods that I could have as a part of my calculator program.

Day 3: I worked on the calculator program and made it working by switching from a while loop to recursion. I made options for trig and inverse trig, the basic four
square root, cube root, and exponents. I then started to work on an alarm clock which I will try and implement a sound which I havent done before in java.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/play-audio-file-using-java/ is what I used to begin to learn what sound to play.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-util-timer-class-java/ for the timer and to understand the clock

Day 4: I learned that using the timer class is probably not the best way because it is used for much more complex problems. Also, I was struggling with the wait and try catch. I could 
get it to run without errors, but the wait method would never actually make the program wait and there was no stop in the amount of time that is waited.
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/java-threads-second/1565924185/ch04s04.html is a website I began to use to learn more about wait and try catch, but as of now it hasn't worked as I
have not gotten it done.

Day 5: I finally created a way to make the program wait for the desired time I had to have Jacob come over and help with my program. I used a try catch for the sleep method.
I used https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/sleep.html to help learn about the sleep method and how to use it in a try catch loop.
Im suprised that the other ways that I was trying didnt work and how easily this worked suprised me.
